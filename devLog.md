**GEMINI ACTION LOG**
1.  Checked for `prompt.md` and `devLog.md` in the root directory.
2.  Created `prompt.md` with the header: `# prompt.md — Prompt Log (chronological)`.
3.  Created `devLog.md` with the header: `# devLog.md — Development Log (chronological)`.
4.  Created `requirements.txt` with the content:
    ```
    streamlit
    numpy
    matplotlib
    pandas
    ```
5.  Read `prompt.md` to prepare for logging user prompts.
6.  Appended user prompt history to `prompt.md`.
7.  Read `devLog.md` to prepare for logging development actions.
8.  Created Python virtual environment in `.venv`.
9.  Created `app.py` with placeholder Streamlit title.
10. Installed packages from `requirements.txt` into the `.venv` virtual environment.
11. Overwrote `README.md` with a detailed project description, setup instructions, and file structure based on the CRISP-DM template.
12. Added `scikit-learn` to `requirements.txt` for R-squared calculation.
13. Installed the new dependency.
14. Replaced the placeholder `app.py` with a full-featured interactive linear regression application, including CRISP-DM tabs, interactive plots, outlier analysis, and report downloading.
15. Updated `app.py` to include a bootstrap 95% confidence interval for the regression line, with new UI controls and plotting logic.
16. Refactored `app.py` to simplify the UI, removing CRISP-DM tabs and consolidating the main features onto a single page.
17. Added `tabulate` to `requirements.txt` and installed it to fix an `ImportError`.
18. Removed the 'Logging & Reporting' and 'Download Report' sections from the sidebar in `app.py`.
19. Updated `README.md` to reflect the final application state, revising the project description and file structure details.
